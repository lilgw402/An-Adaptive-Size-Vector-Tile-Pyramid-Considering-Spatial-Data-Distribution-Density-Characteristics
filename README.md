# An-Adaptive-Size-Vector-Tile-Pyramid-Considering-Spatial-Data-Distribution-Density-Characteristics

## Introduction

This project proposes a novel three-step method for dynamically adjusting tile sizes based on spatial data distribution density during construction. It addresses the issues commonly encountered in traditional vector tile construction methods, such as excessive tile quantity and data volume imbalance between tiles.

## Development Platform

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need the following:
Visual Studio 2015 or above: Ensure you have Visual Studio 2015 or a more recent version installed.

## Method Overview

Our approach consists of three main steps:

1. **Data Generalization**: In this step, we transform raw data into a multi-resolution vector dataset, encompassing varying levels of detail.

2. **Quadtree-based Construction**: For each level within the dataset, we employ a quadtree-based approach to construct adaptive-size vector tiles that align with specific spatial distribution density characteristics.

3. **Geohash Encoding**: Finally, we encode these differently-sized vector tiles using Geohash technology to facilitate spatial indexing and internet transmission.
